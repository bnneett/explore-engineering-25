    "\n",
    "> In programming, a function is an entire block of code wrapped up into one line. Every time you use that one line, you run the entire block.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you can give it input, and sometimes it'll give you something back. But overall, a function is like it's own little program you can run whenever you want.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are both what're called native functions, like `print()` or `input()` that come with Python, and functions that you as the programmer can create.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## üí° Why do we use functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "- To avoid repeating blocks of code\n",
    "- To organize a program into sections\n",
    "- To make your code easier to read and fix (just like variables!)\n",
    "\n",
    "In more literal terms, functions have two main purposes in your program: to do a task, or to give you something back.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üí° How do we make functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The syntax is pretty straightforward, but there are some important things to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the keyword `def` to start a function definition\n",
    "- Name your function after it's purpose, like you would a tool (`greet_user()`, `roll_dice()`, etc.)\n",
    "- The `()` is where inputs go (more on this later)\n",
    "- Use a `:` to start the block\n",
    "- Make sure everything you want included in the function is indented\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's take a look at some basic functions that don't require input.\n"
